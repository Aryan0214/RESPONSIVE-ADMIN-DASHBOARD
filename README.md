## RESPONSIVE ADMIN DASHBOARD 
In this admin dashboard We can see all the sales, visits, courses information and many more. I used HTML and CSS for all the stlying and JavaScript to add functionality.

## Things Learnt 
I learnt how to manage flex layouts inside the grid layouts to create partition in three parts and furthermore nesting flex inside the grid layout for main part and asides. I too learnt how to add dark mode to a website using JavaScript and hamburger menu too. It was great building the project.![screenshot1](https://github.com/Aryan0214/RESPONSIVE-ADMIN-DASHBOARD/assets/151533389/ae3e8252-c40c-407f-8a04-c60bb12df41a)
